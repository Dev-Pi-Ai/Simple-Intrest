# Simple-Intrest
This is another of my first projects that I wrote in C, this is a simple compound intrest calculator that is very handy for investing, managing debt, etc.
This project uses <stdio.h> and only works in the command line. I would appreciate feedback on how to improve my code and further develop my skills as a C
programmer.
